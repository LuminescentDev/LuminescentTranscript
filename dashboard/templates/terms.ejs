    <h2>By using Pup's services in any form, you agree to the following privacy policy / terms of use and the storage of your data.</h2>

    <h3>1. What information is stored?</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>GuildId for settings</li>
            <li>UserId for punishments and vote data</li>
            <li>MessageId for reaction roles (only messages with reaction roles)</li>
            <li>All information set in your guild's settings are stored</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>2. Why this information is stored and how its used:</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li>We store your guildId to keep track of which settings are for which guild</li>
        <li>We store your userId if you have been banned/muted from a guild, it gets deleted afterwards.</li>
        <li>We store your userId if you have voted to make sure you are able to use certain vote-locked features.</li>
        <li>We store the messageId of reaction roles for the bot to actually find the message on reaction.</li>
        <li>All information set in your guild's settings are stored for reference, and basically make the bot work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Who gets this stored data?</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Settings data is available to administrators of your guild.</li>
      <li>All other data is only available to the Pup developer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. What else?</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li>The developer may at times join any server Pup is in for any good reason (usually for testing purposes or if there's a server-specific error), the invite link is not shared with anyone else and will leave the server afterwards. (This rarely happens)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For any questions and/or concerns about stored data and/or how to remove it please create a ticket in the <a href="/discord">Support Server</a>.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>You may not abuse any of Pup's services in any way shape or form for any malicious reason.</h3>
    <h2>Note: We reserve the right to change this without notifying our users.</h2>
